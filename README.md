# co2_emissions_forecasting
This project involves creating a forecasting model using the monthly CO2 emissions of the past 43 years of data to forecast the monthly CO2 emissions for the next 10 years.

Steps included in the project:

1. Upload the CSV data
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to make the data ready for creating ML models. Exploratory Data Analysis include dealing with missing values, renaming columns, chaging the datatypes accordingly, finding any outliers in the data.
3. Utilize matplotlib and seaborn to create different plots to visualize the data and look for any trends.
4. Creating SARIMA and ARIMA models to predict the next 10 years of data accordingly.
